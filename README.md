Engine made using SDL2 v0.37.0.

# Doom Engine in Rust ðŸ¦€
I started this project in order to learn Rust, so I'm probably not using the best practices and recommendations for the language.

Based on the video made by [The Old School Coder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7f9p9nDsmc), where he implements the engine using C, so the credit for the implementation is all his. 
- Original Code in C written by [jeuxdemains](https://github.com/jeuxdemains/DOOM-like-game-engine-part-I/tree/main)
- **This project is a rewrite in Rust**.
